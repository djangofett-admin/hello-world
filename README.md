Hello World!

My name is Ethan and I am looking to make my way into the world of coding. I am starting out by learning the Django framework. as well as HTML5, CSS, and Vanilla JS to start creating the frontend of my website. I hope to one day have a well designed and secure website where I can showcase all of my accomplishments. Not only do I intend to learn many tools through this project, but I also hope to use it as proof of my hopes to one day work as a Software Developer for Apple.
